# DFT
## Overview
This is a compression between DFT and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) FFT algorithm.

## FFT vs. DFT
In fact FFT is fast way to calculate DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) .  both help to transform signal to frequency domain so the order of computation can be minimum.

## How to run?
1. Install [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) using pip:
`sudo pip install numpy`
2. Install mathplotlib using pip:
`sudo pip install mathplotlib`
3. Download whole project and extract in one folder.
4. Execute DFT.py file.
